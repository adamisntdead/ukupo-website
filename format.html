          The first phase of the tournament is a series of online qualifiers,
          each of which is an MTT (multi-table tournament). There will be four
          qualifiers, each with its own prize pool to compete for. The
          qualifiers are open, which means that all UK university students are
          free to participate, and there is no cap on how many students can
          participate per university. Players can (and are encouraged to) join
          as many qualifiers as they want to. These qualifiers will be played on
          ClubGG.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prizes aside, each of these qualifiers will have 1000 points up for
          grabs (i.e. regardless of the number of participants), and points are
          distributed based on placements — 20% of the field will be awarded
          points according to ClubGG’s distribution. For each player, we will
          consider their aggregate point total from their top 3 performances,
          with 0 points being awarded for each tournament a player misses. This
          system therefore incentivises a player to play in all four
          tournaments, but also does not punish the best players from missing
          just one qualifier for whatever reason.
        </p>

        <p>
          Based on the point rankings, we will invite 40 participants, await
          their responses, then invite people again until there are 40
          participants confirmed for the next round, a live MTT hosted at Jane
          Street’s office in London.
